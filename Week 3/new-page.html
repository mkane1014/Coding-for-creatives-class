													<h1> Global Trade Issue </h1>
																	


				<p id="all"> All across the globe, different currencies are exchanged 
                between countries with a wide variety of monetary systems. <br>
				Great Britain uses the pound, the Czech Republic goes by the 
				koruna, and Western Europe exchanges the Euro. <br>
                One British pound is equivalent to $1.49 in the U.S. dollar. <br>
				You might make the assumption that the United States has the 
				strongest currency, but in fact we do not. <br>
				The American dollar holds less value than the pound and even the 
				Euro, however, the Euro’s value has decreased dramatically. Today,
				 one Euro is equivalent to $1.08 U.S. dollar. <br>


				A weak dollar means higher consumer prices, which leads to budget 
				deficits funded by a net inflow of capital. <br> The United States
			    actually receives more money from other countries which helps 
			    contribute to their economy. <br> There are countries that base 
			    the value of their currency on the U.S. dollar, which prevents it 
			    from rising against the dollar. <br> Whenever you trade there are 
			    barriers. Governments have the right to engage in practices that 
			    impede global free trade. <br> Anti-globalization activists view 
			    free trade as a threat to both the environment and a threat against human rights. <br>The United States have had to put trade 
			    embargoes in place with certain countries in the past, such as Cuba.
			   <br> Recently, President Obama reached an agreement with Cuba to remove the trade embargo. <br> For years, American citizens were not allowed to travel to or trade with Cuba. <br> OPEC limits supply to increase price or impose sanctions on importers to influence political decisions.

               When talking about trade deficits you will notice a difference 
               between the value of goods and services. <br> Goods and services 
               are affected by what a country buys overseas and the services that
                it sells to other countries. <br> A trade surplus exists when the 
                value of exported goods and services is greater than the value of 
                imported goods and services. <br> Trade deficit in the U.S. has 
                led to a major loss of manufacturing and service jobs which leads 
                to less revenue for the government, but higher expenditures on 
                social services. <br> The United States borrows money from foreign 
                investors such as China. <br> As a result, the United States owes 
                trillions of dollars to China. <br> When our economy collapsed, it 
                affected our trade and we lost a large majority of global 
                investors which lead to public sector companies losing revenue.

			   Manufacturers and labor subcontracted to less expensive countries 
			   also negatively affect the economy in the United States.<br>
			   Companies like Nike outsource their products in China or India. <br>
			   These workers have a very low wage and work in a poor work 
			   environment that would not pass OSHA standards. <br> Multinational 
			   corporations are beginning to shift their production to countries 
			   with lower wages and less safety regulations. <br> It’s a way to 
			   hide from higher taxes and produce goods at a much lower cost. <br> 
			   It’s a domestic issue that has taken thousands of jobs away from 
			   Americans. <br>

There are environmental concerns when dealing with global trade as well. <br> 
Environmentalists argue that global trade is inevitable, which leads to a 
disregard for environmental standards. <br> An increase in pollution may be one of 
the largest consequences of global trade’s disregard for environmental standards. <
br>  The United States have enforced fishing and poaching laws on shrimp producers 
in developing countries. <br> They require fishers to use specialized nets to 
protect endangered turtles. <br> Another problem that is being recognized in 
developing countries is the horn of the rhinoceros being cut off for the sale of 
their ivory on the black market. <br> Not only are the poachers committing a 
crime, but they are acting inhumanely by killing these animals.<br>

There are a lot of different factors that go into global trade. <br>
 A solution that I believe could help the United States would be bringing jobs back to America. <br> America’s manufacturing has gone down, which has lead the U.S.to depend solely on oreign labor. <br> Bringing jobs back will lead to a stronger economy and it will ensure safer working conditions. <br> Not only will it make us more self-sufficient but 
it will strengthen our imports and exports.<br> In order to have a strong, successful 
economy you need a strong middle class which can be achieved by giving tax cuts to 
the middle class and placing higher taxes on the one percent. <br> </p>
